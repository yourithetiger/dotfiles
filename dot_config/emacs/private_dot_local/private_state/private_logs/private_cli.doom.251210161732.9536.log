    ! Failed to locate 'Symbols Nerd Font Mono' font on your system
      This font is required for icons in Doom Emacs. To download and install them, do
      one of the following:
      
        - Execute `M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts' from within Doom Emacs (NOTE:     on
          Windows this command will only download them; the fonts must then     be
          installed manually afterwards).
        - Download and install 'Symbols Nerd Font' from https://nerdfonts.com     or via
          your OS package manager. (You'll need to change the     `nerd-icons-font-names'
          and/or `nerd-icons-font-family' variables to     reflect a non-standard file or
          font family name).
