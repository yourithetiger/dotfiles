If you use `&allow-other-keys\\='\n   (or manually ignore other arguments), your code is free from this\n   problem.

The current position in the HTTP\nresponse buffer is at the beginning of the buffer.  As the HTTP\nheader is stripped off, the cursor is actually at the beginning\nof the response body.  So, for example, you can pass `json-read\\='\nto parse JSON object in the buffer.  To fetch whole response as a\nstring, pass `buffer-string\\='.\n\nWhen using `json-read\\=', it is useful to know that the returned\ntype can be modified by `json-object-type\\=', `json-array-type\\=',\n`json-key-type\\=', `json-false\\=' and `json-null\\='.  See docstring of\neach function for what it does.  For example, to convert JSON\nobjects to plist instead of alist, wrap `json-read\\=' by `lambda\\='\nlike this.::\n\n    (request\n     \"https://...\"\n     :parser (lambda ()\n               (let ((json-object-type \\='plist))\n                 (json-read)))\n     ...)\n\nThis is analogous to the `dataType\\=' argument of jQuery.ajax_.\nOnly this function can access to the process buffer, which\nis killed immediately after the execution of this function.\n\n* SYNC\n\nSynchronous request is functional, but *please* don\\='t use it\nother than testing or debugging.  Emacs users have better things\nto do rather than waiting for HTTP request.  If you want a better\nway to write callback chains, use `request-deferred\\='.\n\nIf you can\\='t avoid using it (e.g., you are inside of some hook\nwhich must return some value), make sure to set TIMEOUT to\nrelatively small value.\n\nDue to limitation of `url-retrieve-synchronously\\=', response slots\n`request-response-error-thrown\\=', `request-response-history\\=' and\n`request-response-url\\=' are unknown (always nil) when using\nsynchronous request with `url-retrieve\\=' backend.\n\n* Note\n\nAPI of `request\\=' is somewhat mixture of jQuery.ajax_ (Javascript)\nand requests.request_ (Python).\n\n.. _jQuery.ajax: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/\n.. _requests.request: https://docs.python-requests.org\n\n(fn URL &rest SETTINGS &key (PARAMS nil) (DATA nil) (HEADERS nil) (ENCODING \\='utf-8) (ERROR nil) (SYNC nil) (RESPONSE (make-request-response)) &allow-other-keys)") (function-put 'request 'lisp-indent-function 'defun) (autoload 'request-untrampify-filename "request" "Return FILE as the local file name.\n\n(fn FILE)") (autoload 'request-abort "request" "Abort request for RESPONSE (the object returned by `request').\nNote that this function invoke ERROR and COMPLETE callbacks.\nCallbacks may not be called immediately but called later when\nassociated process is exited.\n\n(fn RESPONSE)") nil) (let* ((load-file-name "/home/Youri621/.config/emacs/.local/straight/build-30.2/dumb-jump/dumb-jump-autoloads.el") (load-true-file-name load-file-name)) (defvar dumb-jump-mode-map (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (define-key map (kbd "C-M-g") 'dumb-jump-go) (define-key map (kbd "C-M-p") 'dumb-jump-back) (define-key map (kbd "C-M-q") 'dumb-jump-quick-look) map)) (autoload 'dumb-jump-back "dumb-jump" "Jump back to where the last jump was done." t) (autoload 'dumb-jump-quick-look "dumb-jump" "Run dumb-jump-go in quick look mode.

All pairs (when not\nignored) will be recorded and can be later displayed with\n`general-describe-keybindings'.\n\nIf DEFINER is specified, a custom key definer will be used to bind MAPS. See\ngeneral.el's documentation/README for more information.\n\nUnlike with normal key definitions functions, the keymaps in KEYMAPS should be\nquoted (this allows using the keymap name for other purposes, e.g. deferring\nkeybindings if the keymap symbol is not bound, optionally inferring the\ncorresponding major mode for a symbol by removing \"-map\" for :which-key,\neasily storing the keymap name for use with `general-describe-keybindings',\netc.). Note that general.el provides other key definer macros that do not\nrequire quoting keymaps.\n\nSTATES corresponds to the evil state(s) to bind the keys in. Non-evil users\nshould not set STATES. When STATES is non-nil, `evil-define-key*' will be\nused (the evil auxiliary keymaps corresponding STATES and KEYMAPS will be used);\notherwise `define-key' will be used (unless DEFINER is specified). KEYMAPS\ndefaults to 'global. There is also 'local, which create buffer-local\nkeybindings for both evil and non-evil keybindings. There are other special,\nuser-alterable \"shorthand\" symbols for keymaps and states (see\n`general-keymap-aliases' and `general-state-aliases').\n\nNote that STATES and KEYMAPS can either be lists or single symbols. If any\nkeymap does not exist, those keybindings will be deferred until the keymap does\nexist, so using `eval-after-load' is not necessary with this function.\n\nPREFIX corresponds to a key to prefix keys in MAPS with and defaults to none. To\nbind/unbind a key specified with PREFIX, \"\" can be specified as a key in\nMAPS (e.g. ...:prefix \"SPC\" \"\" nil... will unbind space).\n\nThe keywords in this paragraph are only useful for evil users. If\nNON-NORMAL-PREFIX is specified, this prefix will be used instead of PREFIX for\nstates in `general-non-normal-states' (e.g. the emacs and insert states). This\nargument will only have an effect if one of these states is in STATES or if\ncorresponding global keymap (e.g. `evil-insert-state-map') is in KEYMAPS.\nAlternatively, GLOBAL-PREFIX can be used with PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX to\nbind keys in all states under the specified prefix. Like with NON-NORMAL-PREFIX,\nGLOBAL-PREFIX will prevent PREFIX from applying to `general-non-normal-states'.\nINFIX can be used to append a string to all of the specified prefixes. This is\npotentially useful when you are using GLOBAL-PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX so\nthat you can sandwich keys in between all the prefixes and the specified keys in\nMAPS. This may be particularly useful if you are using default prefixes in a\nwrapper function/macro so that you can add to them without needing to re-specify\nall of them. If none of the other prefix keyword arguments are specified, INFIX\nwill have no effect.\n\nIf PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP is specified, a prefix command and/or keymap\nwill be created. PREFIX-NAME can be additionally specified to set the keymap\nmenu name/prompt. If PREFIX-COMMAND is specified, `define-prefix-command' will\nbe used. Otherwise, only a prefix keymap will be created. Previously created\nprefix commands/keymaps will never be redefined/cleared. All prefixes (including\nthe INFIX key, if specified) will then be bound to PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP.\nIf the user did not specify any PREFIX or manually specify any KEYMAPS, general\nwill bind all MAPS in the prefix keymap corresponding to either PREFIX-MAP or\nPREFIX-COMMAND instead of in the default keymap.\n\nPREDICATE corresponds to a predicate to check to determine whether a definition\nshould be active (e.g. \":predicate '(eobp)\"). Definitions created with a\npredicate will only be active when the predicate is true. When the predicate is\nfalse, key lookup will continue to search for a match in lower-precedence\nkeymaps.\n\nIn addition to the normal definitions supported by `define-key', general.el also\nprovides \"extended\" definitions, which are plists containing the normal\ndefinition as well as other keywords. For example, PREDICATE can be specified\nglobally or locally in an extended definition. New global (~general-define-key~)\nand local (extended definition) keywords can be added by the user. See\n`general-extended-def-keywords' and general.el's documentation/README for more\ninformation.\n\nPACKAGE is the global version of the extended definition keyword that specifies\nthe package a keymap is defined in (used for \"autoloading\" keymaps)\n\nPROPERTIES, REPEAT, and JUMP are the global versions of the extended definition\nkeywords used for adding evil command properties to commands.\n\nMAJOR-MODES, WK-MATCH-KEYS, WK-MATCH-BINDINGS, and WK-FULL-KEYS are the\ncorresponding global versions of which-key extended definition keywords. They\nwill only have an effect for extended definitions that specify :which-key or\n:wk.
